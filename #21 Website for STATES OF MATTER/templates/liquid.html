        <h1>Liquid</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its 
            container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure.
             As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter 
             (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a 
             definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating
            particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds.
            Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container.
            Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. 
            Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a 
            container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive 
            property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting 
            phenomena. Water is by far the most common liquid on Earth.</p>
